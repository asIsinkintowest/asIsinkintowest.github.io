## background

* Sail to the moon,which is always my dream.Since I'm a child I have been attracted by the beautiful stories of moon, So I choose "moon" as the subject.
* By the way, one more reason is the recently released cartoon named Cyberpunk Edgerunners. It tells a group of people living in the Night City and finally died one by one. Which impressed me most is the heroine's dream - sail to the moon, and this is also a factor.

## project

* It's used to provide a platform to introduce myself and also give a chance to show my fantastic ideas.
* The website is a better language than just talkiNg. Because of the visualisation, I could express my thought more intuitively.
* It's also a happy thing to build interaction.

## instruction

* The index is the home page. It shows some images about my homedown, which photoed during my high school period. Put "start" can entry the next page.
* The next page is intrudoction. Both the Pictures on the left and the words on the right could be srolled.
* The third page is about my view of software. I explain why I choose this subject.The page is easy and you just need to roll.
* Then there is some of my bad flavour.The ad is fake and if you put "exit", you will go to a viedo.Under the page laid a moon, click it and accept my joke.
